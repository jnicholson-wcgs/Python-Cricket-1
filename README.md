# Python-Cricket-1
Initial routines and testing for the WCGS Cricket program
The task implements the following routines:
1) over() - collect the score for an over
2) innings() - collect the scores for a set number of overs
3) match () - run the scoring to a match between two teams

All students should be able to implement all these rouintes correctly.
Some students will have better testing and validation
Some students will implement the "try and except" validation in the over() routine
