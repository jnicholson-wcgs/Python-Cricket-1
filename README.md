# Python-Cricket-1
Initial routines and testing for the WCGS Cricket program.

Background
----------

The WCGS sports department need some assistance for the cricket season and require a program 
to keep track of the scores for cricket match fixtures

The Task
--------

The task requires you to implement the following routines:
1) over() - subroutine to collect the score for an over
2) innings() - subroutine to collect the scores for a set number of overs
3) match () - procedure to run the scoring to a match between two teams

All students should be able to implement all these rouintes correctly.
Some students will have better testing and validation
Some students will implement the "try and except" validation in the over() routine
